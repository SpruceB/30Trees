    Understanding what CBB is doing on your farm will help you treat it.  This simple method will show you total infestation levels, but more importantly, it will show whether the beetle is vulnerable to being killed by spray.  Begin sampling about 60 days after your initial flowering and continue monthly or as needed through harvest.  Depending on your farm size and topography, a single lot of 30 trees might be sufficient, or you may need to subdivide into smaller lots (for example shaded areas versus sun).
